o Initialization - Create an initial random population of the desired size.

o Evaluation - Each member of the population is then evaluated to calculate the fitness for that individual. The fitness value represents how well it fits with the desired requirements. 

o Selection - Discarding the bad designs and only keep the best individuals in the population to improve the overall population fitnesses. 

o Crossover - Create new individuals by combining aspects of the selected individuals. By combining certain traits from two or more individuals there is the possibility to create a 'fitter' offspring which should inherit the best traits from each of it's parents.

o Mutation - Make very small random changes to an individual, just add a bit of randomness into our population's individuals otherwise every created combination of solutions would be in our initial population.

o Repeat the steps starting from 2 (Evaluation) with the new generation created, till a termination condition is reached.
